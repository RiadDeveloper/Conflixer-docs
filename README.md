### Prerequisites
Before installing Conflixer, ensure your system meets the following requirement:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** version 8 or above must be installed on your machine. This is essential as Conflixer relies on Java to function properly.

If you donâ€™t have JDK installed, you can download it from the official [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) or use a package manager like `brew` on macOS or `apt` on Linux.

### ðŸªŸ Installation on Windows
Follow these steps to install Conflixer on a Windows machine:

1. **Open PowerShell**: You can do this by searching for "PowerShell" in your Start menu.

2. **Run the Installation Command**: Copy and paste the following command into PowerShell, then hit `Enter`:
    ```ps1
    iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jewelshkjony/Conflixer/1.0.0/install.ps1 -useb | iex
    ```
    This command downloads and installs Conflixer directly to your system.

3. **Start Conflixer**: Once the installation is complete, simply type `Conflixer` in the PowerShell terminal to start the tool.

### ðŸ’» Installation on Linux and macOS
For users on Linux or macOS, the installation process is just as simple:

1. **Open Terminal**: Access your terminal from the applications menu or by using a shortcut like `Ctrl + Alt + T` (Linux) or `Command + Space`, then type `Terminal` (macOS).

2. **Run the Installation Command**: Enter the following command in the terminal and press `Enter`:
    ```sh
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jewelshkjony/Conflixer/1.0.0/install.sh -fsSL | sh

## :running_man: Quick Start Guide

Now that you have Conflixer installed, letâ€™s dive into how you can use it to resolve conflicts between extensions. This guide will walk you through each step, making it easy even if youâ€™re not a technical expert.

### Step 1: Launch Conflixer
- Open your terminal (PowerShell on Windows or Terminal on Linux/macOS) and type `Conflixer`, then press `Enter`.

### Step 2: Provide the Required Inputs
- **Enter aix to keep**: The tool will prompt you to provide the path to the `.aix` file that you want to keep as a reference. This is the extension that you prefer or need to maintain in its current form.
  - You can either type the full path or drag and drop the `.aix` file into the terminal window.

- **Enter aix to target**: Next, youâ€™ll be asked to provide the path to the `.aix` file that is conflicting with the reference file. This is the extension that Conflixer will analyze and modify to resolve any conflicts.
  - Again, you can type the path or drag and drop the file into the terminal.

### Step 3: Automatic Conflict Resolution
- After youâ€™ve provided the necessary inputs, Conflixer will start processing. It will compare the two `.aix` files and automatically resolve any conflicts between them.
- This process usually takes just a few seconds.

### Step 4: Use the Resolved `.aix` File
- Once the tool completes its job, it will generate a new `.aix` file that is free from conflicts. 
- You can now use this resolved `.aix` file alongside the original reference file without worrying about any compatibility issues.

### Example Scenario
Imagine you have two extensions that you love, but they canâ€™t be installed together due to conflicts. Conflixer steps in to merge them intelligently, allowing you to enjoy the benefits of both without the headache of manual troubleshooting.

## ðŸ“‹ Additional Tips

- **Backup Your Files**: Before running Conflixer, itâ€™s a good idea to create backups of your original `.aix` files. This way, you can always revert if needed.
- **Multiple Runs**: If youâ€™re working with multiple conflicting extensions, you can run Conflixer multiple times, each time targeting a different conflict.
